INTRODUCTION
   estruct2peg is a program converts the EBNF grammar for various
   versions of Electronic Design Interchange Format (EDIF) into the 'peg'
   format that is needed to create an EDIF parser using pep.

HISTORY
   The conversion of EDIF v200 grammar to 'peg' format was originally
   done manually using search&replace inside Emacs.  That was tedious
   but quicker than writing a tool to do the conversion.  That manual
   process could also have been done for EDIF v300 ... .etc. after it
   was finalized.  However, during the EDIF v300 design process it was
   desirable to be able to generate&parse these interim versions to
   validate the EDIF design.  The interim versions were being
   generated on a weekly and sometimes daily basis so doing the
   conversion manually was not practical.  Thus esruct2peg was written
   to automate the conversion.

   Although created for v300 and above, estruct2peg can convert the
   original EDIF v200 grammar which is publically available as :-

   Note that unlike the original .d files which just had LF
   line-endings whoever put those files online used Windows and so
   inadvertently changed the line edings to CR LF.  Since that
   happened after estruct2peg was written it doesn't support CR in the
   input and so if you want to use the above yoiu'll need to strip the
   CR first.

   Given that estruct2peg was designed to facilitate the conversion of
   EDIF v300 and EDIF v400 grammars it is somewhat ironic that, as far
   as I am aware, these grammars in their original format are not
   freely available online -- you have to buy them from EIA or some
   other national standards body.

   You can find a grammars for EDIF v300 and EDIF v400 in a format
   that is quite close to 'peg' as the file 'edifsyn.dat' in the EDIF
   parsers that were made freely available by the Univerity of
   Manchester in the late 1990s and which can still be found at :-

   The fact that those files are publically available mean that
   estruct2peg is more for historical reference than necessity since
   it would now be easier to convert that peg-like format into peg
   with some minor editing.

   The program was originally written in 1994 under Linux 0.99 and
   compiled using gcc and lcc.  At various points in time it also ran
   on SunOS 4.0 and Solaris.

   Since it is almost a throw-away program it does not attempt to deal
   with malloc(3) failing nor does it attempt to free the memory it
   allocates.

BUILD
   This is a developer tool not an end-user product so there is no
   autoconf, just type :-

      $ make

   and if that doesn't work for your platform then fix the ./Makefile
   to suite your system.

RUN
   The converter takes the syntax file on standard input and writes
   the result to the standard output.

      $ ./estruct2peg < estruct0.d > edif200.peg
